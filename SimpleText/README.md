# pyterrier_and_bert.py
  - gets top 500 results per topic_id with both pyterrier and bert independently
  
# combine_scores.py
  - merges both files by combining scores with magic formula if both models predicted same document and returning top 100 per topic (highest scores)
  - if not found in other file, the score will be penalized since the score would potentially be doubled if found in both
  - also fixes problems when originally getting intersection as if there is no intersection, we will still have a top 100 results
